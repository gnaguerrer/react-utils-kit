# useAppState

React hook that monitors the app's state (active, background, or inactive) in a React Native application. It allows you to react to changes in the app's state, making it easier to manage functionalities that depend on whether the app is in the foreground or background.

## Usage

```typescript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const appState = useAppState();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (appState === "active") {
      // Perform actions
    } else {
      // Perform other actions
    }
  }, [appState]);

  return <View>{/* Your content */}</View>;
};
```

### Returns

| Property | Description                                             | Type     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| appState | Current state of the app (active, background, inactive) | `string` |

### Notes

- The `appState` string can have one of the following values:
  - `'active'`: The app is in the foreground and receiving events.
  - `'background'`: The app is in the background and not visible to the user.
  - `'inactive'`: The app is transitioning between states, such as when the user receives a call.
